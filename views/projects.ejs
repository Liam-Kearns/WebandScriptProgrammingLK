          <p>This project was the final project for Object Oriented Programming, 
            it consisted of six different encryption algorithms, the user would 
            enter a plain text string, the program would choose a random 
            encryption method and then encrypt the users string and when the 
            user was ready they could decrypt their stings and see their, 
            unencrypted string, encrypted string and the randomly generated 
            encryption key.</p>

          <p>This was the final project for Intro to Programming, 
            the program is a game where a random word is chosen and 
            the user chooses how many letters they can guess before
             the game is over, if the user guesses correctly they win 
             the game, if not they can repeat and try again.</p>

           <!-- project discription -->

          <p>This project is still being developed at this time* 
            The plan for this project is to make a python based 
            application that will have algorithms for each type of 
            event in my life; lectures, appointments, work. These 
            algorithms will have access to my email, OTU schedule 
            as well as my posted work schedule, it will determine 
            any overlaps, cancellations and even rescheduling automatically.
